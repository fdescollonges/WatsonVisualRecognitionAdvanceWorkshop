# IBM Watson Visual Recognition 

# Advance Worshop

Visual Recognition is  is already  used  broadly,  from  detecting  a  specific  type  of  plants,  counting chickens,  automatic  processing  of  car  damage  claims  in insurance  or  for  self-driving  cars  to  give  a  few examples.

This repository contains the exercices of the IBM Watson Visual Recognition Advance Workshop

This workshop of 1 day and half allows clients and partners to understand how IBM Watson Visual Recognition on IBM Cloud can augment existing applications by providing cognitive capabilities. 

The workshop includes lectures, discussions on how Watson Visual Recognition service works, and hands-on  exercises that participants can use to better understand what the service does, what it doesnâ€™t do, and how it works so that students can accurately identify opportunities where Watson Visual Recognition will add  value  to  potential  solutions.  

During  this  workshop  we'll  look  at  a  few  examples  and  talk  about  the algorithms that are under the hood of Visual Recognition services. Then it'll be your time to get your hands-on one of this service and create your own solution

At the end of this workshop, students will have covered the following topics:

- Visual Recognition Challenges & Use Cases
- Visual Recognition Out-of-the-box Tooling
- Visual Recognition defaults models with Out-of-the-box tools
- Custom Model considerations
- Creating custom models with Out-of-the-box tools
- APIs and development tools for Visual Recognition
- Develop Visual Recognition applications with Node-Red
- Existing usages and extended considerations
